# Operating Systems via Command Line

## LINUX 🐧

 This repository aims to focus on the practical aspects of the Linux operating system through the *command line*✨

 The command line inputs text commands instead of relying on a *graphical user interface or GUI* 🖱 If this is your first time using a command line for any OS, you maight find this repository little intimidating 😅 at first. That's totally normal, but you'll be good to go 😎 after referring to these scripts where I tried to cover most of the basic tasks that you may need to know ✌

 This repository covers areas including:

 ✔ Handling files and directories(folders) 

 ✔ Managing users and file permissions

✔ Package and software management

✔ Filesystems

✔ Process Management

✔ Logs
