# Operating Systems via Command Line

## _LINUX_

 This repository aims to focus more on the practical aspects of the Linux operating system through the command line

 *The command line inputs text commands instead of relying on a graphical user interface or GUI. If this is your first time using a command line for any OS, you may find this repo a little intimidating at first. That's totally normal, but you'll be good to go by refering to these scripts where I tried to include most of the tasks that you may need to know about.*
