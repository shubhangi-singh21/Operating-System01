# Operating Systems via Command Line

## LINUX

 This repository aims to focus more on the practical aspects of the Linux operating system through the *command line*

 The command line inputs text commands instead of relying on a *graphical user interface or GUI*. If this is your first time using a command line for any OS, you may find this repo a little intimidating at first. That's totally normal, but you'll be good to go by refering to these scripts where I tried to include most of the tasks that you may need to know about.

 This repository covers areas including:
 - Handling files and directories(folders) 
 - Managing users and file permissions
 - Package and software management
 - Filesystems
 - Process Management
 - Logs
